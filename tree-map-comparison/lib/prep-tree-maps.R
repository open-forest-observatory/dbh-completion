# Function to prepare predicted and observed tree maps for comparison by:
# - projecting the predicted trees to the same projection as the observed trees
# - assigning unique IDs to each tree
# - assigning the trees an attribute that designates whether they are within the internally-buffered region
# - adding an (empty for now) attribute that will store which predicted tree the observed tree is matched to
# It modifies the original files provided to it.
