# R functions used when matching predicted (drone) trees with observed (stem map) trees

# Function to match predicted trees against a single set (e.g. overstory trees only, or all trees) of observed trees. This is wrapped inside the match_trees function which runs it once for all trees and (if specified) once for overstory only.

  # 
  # for each observed tree, compute distance to every predicted tree that is a candidate:
  #   within distance window function scaled by height of the observed tree
  # within height window range based on height of the observed tree
  # 
  # Logic:
  #   
  #   compute distance matrix for all observed to all predicted
  # Thin to only those distances within the radius for the tallest trees
  # 
  # for each observed point:
  #   compute its acceptable distance and height interval
  # thin to only points within the height interval
  # find all points within its acceptable horizontal distance
  # 
  # This produces a df of all the potential matches between predicteds and observeds, with their distances
  # 
  # Find the closest matches:
  #   Sort the matches list in ascending order
  # For each potential match:
  #   see if the predicted or observed is already matched (keep a running list)
  # if not, record the match, and add the predicted and observed IDs to the already-matched pool
